# Morse-Code-Keyboard
Why use your boring old keyboard when you can use this fancy one that types in morse code! :)

"mck.zip" has all the files you need.



MorseKill.bat ends the fancy code. ALL num and letters are needed. The ".cpp" is what runs all the code.
OR
For idiots just download the ".zip" and open it. Then copy the first folder into YOUR files.
